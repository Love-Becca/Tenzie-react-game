# Tenzie-react-game
A react project from bob Ziroll React tutorial
:Tenzie is a dice game for kids
so far I have being able to use React useState on this project in order to make the game interactive
I have implement random number generator, each random number has a unique Id and perfectly generated as a component which I then use React useState to make some changes when users interact with the game.

**I plan to add real dots,track time to win and add score to it**
